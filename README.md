A C++/C calculator for bash.

# How to Compile

### C Executable

* In your shell, run
```
make c
```
* Then run the executable by doing
```
./bashcalcC
```

### C++ Executable

* In your shell, run
```
make cpp
```
* Then run the executable by doing

If you don't add c/cpp/clean when running the Makefile it will compile the C variant.
